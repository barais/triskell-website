<h3>Research fields</h3><br/>

<p>In its broad acceptation, Software Engineering consists in proposing practical solutions, founded on scientific knowledge, in order to produce and maintain software with constraints on costs, quality and deadlines. In this field, it is admitted that the complexity of a software increases exponentially with its size. However on the one hand, the size itself of the software is on average multiplied by ten every ten years, and on the other hand, the economic pressure resulted reducing the durations of development, and in increasing the rates of modifications made to the software.<br /><br /></p>

<p>To face these problems, today's mainstream approaches build on the concept of component based software. The assembly of these components makes it possible to build families of products made of many common parts, while remaining opened to new evolutions. As component based systems grow more complex and mission-critical, there is an increased need to be able to represent and reason on such assemblies of components. This is usually done by building models representing various aspects of such a product line, such as for example the functional variations, the structural aspects (object paradigm), of the dynamic aspects (languages of scenarios), without neglecting of course nonfunctional aspects like quality of service (performance, reliability, etc.) described in the form of contracts, or the characteristics of deployment, which become even dominating in the field of reactive systems, which are often distributed and real-time. Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is then a sub-domain of software engineering focusing on reinforcing design, validation and test methodologies based on the automatic processing of multi-dimensional models.</p>


<h3>Project-team presentation overview</h3><br /><br />

<p>The research domain of the Triskell project is the model driven development of software product lines. Triskell is particularly interested in component based reactive and large scale distributed systems with quality of service constraints, including reliability, performance, timeliness etc.<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Triskell's main objective is to develop model-based methods and tools to help the software designer to efficiently obtain a certain degree of confidence in the reliability of component assemblies that may include third-party components.  This involves, in particular, investigating modeling languages allowing specification of both functional and non-functional aspects for software engineering activities ranging from requirements to detailled design.  It also involves building a continuum of tools which make use of these models, from model validation and verification, automatic application of design patterns, to test environments and on-line monitors supervising the behavior of the components in Dynamically Adaptable Systems. Since these modeling languages and associated tools appear quite open-ended and very domain specific, there is a growing need for <i>tools for building tools for building software</i>.  Triskell is hence developping <a href="http://www.kermeta.org">KerMeta </a>as an original meta modeling approach allowing the user to fully define his modeling languages (including dynamic semantics) and associated environments (including interpreters, compilers, importers/exporters, etc.)  within Eclipse.</p><br /><p>To avoid the pitfall of developping <i>tools for building tools for the sake of it</i>, the Triskell project also has the goal of explicitly connecting its research results to industrial problems through collaborations with industry and technology transfer actions. This implies, in particular, taking into account the industrial standards of the field, namely the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), the OMG's Meta-Object Facility (MOF) and Unified Modeling Language (UML), as well as domain specific component models such as OSGi.</p><br /><br />


<h3>Scientific foundations</h3>
<p>The Triskell project studies new techniques for the reliable construction of
software product lines, especially for distributed and reactive software. The
key problems are components modeling and the development of formal manipulation
tools to refine the design, code generation and test activities. The validation
techniques used are based on complex simulations of models building on the
standards in the considered domain.<br />
<br /></p>


<h4>The object-oriented approach to Software Engineering</h4>
<p><b>keywords :</b> Objects, design patterns, frameworks, software components, UML.</p><br />
<br />
<p>The object-oriented approach is now widespread for the analysis, the design,
and the implementation of software systems. Rooted in the idea of modeling
(through its origin in Simula), object-oriented analysis, design and
implementation takes into account the incremental, iterative and evolutive
nature of software development [<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/goals.htm#Jackson85"><cite>16</cite></a><cite>, </cite><a href="http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/goals.htm#Booch94"><cite>6</cite></a>]: large software system
are seldom developed from scratch, and maintenance activities represent a large
share of the overall development effort.</p><br />
<br />
<p>In the object-oriented approach, objects are instances of classes. A class
encapsulates a single abstraction in a modular way. A class is both <em>closed</em>,
in the sense that it can be readily instanciated and used by clients objects,
and <em>open</em>, that is subject to modifications through inheritance [<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/goals.htm#Meyer87"><cite>22</cite></a>].</p><br />
<br />
<p>Since by definition objects are simple to design and understand, complexity in
an object-oriented system is well known to be in the <em>collaboration</em>
between objects, and large systems cannot be understood at the level of classes
and objects. Still these complex collaborations are made of recurring patterns,
called design patterns. The idea of systematically identifying and documenting design patterns as autonomous
entities was born in the late 80's. It was brought into the mainstream by such people as
Beck, Ward, Coplien, Booch, Kerth, Johnson, etc. (known as the Hillside Group).
However the main event in this emerging field was the publication, in 1995, of the
book <em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software</em> by
the so-called Gang of Four (GoF), that is Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph
Johnson and John Vlissides [<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/goals.htm#Gamma95"><cite>8</cite></a>].
Today, design patterns are widely accepted as useful tools for guiding
and documenting the design of object-oriented software systems. Design patterns
play many roles in the development process. They provide a common vocabulary
for design, they reduce system complexity by naming and defining abstractions,
they constitute a base of experience for building reusable software, and they
act as building blocks from which more complex designs can be built.
Design patterns can be considered reusable micro-architectures that contribute
to an overall system architecture. Ideally, they capture the intent behind a
design by identifying the component objects, their collaborations, and the
distribution of responsibilities.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Frameworks are also closely related to design patterns. An object-oriented
software framework is made up of a set of related classes which can be
specialized or instantiated to implement an application. It is a reusable
software architecture that provides the generic structure and behavior for a
family of software applications, along with a context which specifies their
collaboration and use within a given domain [<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/goals.htm#Appleton97"><cite>1</cite></a>]. A framework
differs from a complete application in that it lacks the necessary
application-specific functionality. It can be considered as a prefabricated
structure, or template, of a working application, where a number of pieces in
specific places, called <em>plug-points</em> or <em>hot spots</em>, are either not
implemented or given overridable implementations. To obtain a complete
application from a framework, one has to provide the missing pieces, usually by
implementing a number of call-back functions (that is, functions that are
invoked by the framework) to fill the plug-points. In an object-oriented
context, this feature is achieved by the dynamic binding: an operation can be
defined in a library class but implemented in a subclass in the application
specific code. A developer can thus customize the framework to a particular
application by subclassing and composing instances of framework
classes [<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/goals.htm#Gamma95"><cite>8</cite></a>]. A framework is thus different from a classical class
library in that the flow of control is usually often bi-directional between the
application and the framework (see Figure <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/goals.htm#framework-vs-lib">??</a>). The
framework is in charge of managing the bulk of the application, and the
application programmer just provides various bits and pieces. This is similar
to programming some event driven applications, when the application programmer
usually has no control over the main control logic of the code.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Design patterns can be used to document the collaborations between
classes in a framework. Conversely, a framework may use several design
patterns, some of them general purpose, some of them
domain-specific. Design patterns and frameworks are thus closely
related, but they do not operate at the same level of abstraction: a
framework <em>is made of</em> software, whereas design patterns represent
knowledge, information and experience <em>about</em> software. In this
respect, frameworks are of a physical nature, while patterns are of a
logical nature: frameworks are the physical realization of one or more
software pattern solutions; patterns are the instructions for how to
implement those solutions.</p><br />
<br />
<p>The object notion also provides the bases needed to develop the concept of <em>software component</em>, for which Szyperski's definition [<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/goals.htm#Szyperski98"><cite>30</cite></a>] is
now generally accepted, at least in the industry:</p>
<blockquote>
    <em>A software component is a unit of composition with contractually
        specified interfaces and explicit context dependencies only. A software
        component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by
        third party.
    </em></blockquote><p>Components help reducing costs by allowing reuse of application frameworks and
components instead of redeveloping applications from scratch (product line
approach). But more important, components offer the possibility to radically
change the behaviors and services offered by an application by substitution or
addition of new components, even a long time after deployment. This has a major
impact of software lifecycle, which should now handle activities such as:</p><br />
<br />
<ul><li>
    design of component frameworks,

</li><li> design of reusable components as deployment units,

</li><li> validation of component compositions coming from various origins,

</li><li> component life-cycle management
</li></ul>
<p>It seems clear that empirical methods without real component composition
models that have appeared during the emergence of a real component industry (at
least in the Windows world) are now the cause of untractable validation and
integration problems can not be transposed to more critical systems (see for
example the accidental destruction of Ariane 501 [<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/goals.htm#Jezequel97a"><cite>19</cite></a>]). <br /></p>
<br />
<p>Providing solutions for formal component composition models and for verifiable
quality (notion of <em>trusted components</em>) are especially relevant
challenges. Also the methodological impact of component-based development (for
example within the maturity model defined by the sei (cmm model))
is also worth attention.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Central to this trusted component notion is the idea of <em>contract</em>. A
software contract captures mutual obligations and benefits among stake-holder
components, for example between the client of a service and its suppliers
(including subclasses). Contracts strengthen and deepen interface
specifications. Along the lines of abstract data type theory, a common way of
specifying software contracts is to use boolean assertions called pre- and
post-conditions for each service offered, as well as class invariants for
defining general consistency properties. Then the contract reads as follows:
the client should only ask a supplier for a service in a state where the class
invariant and the precondition of the service are respected. In return, the
supplier promises that the work specified in the postcondition will be done,
and the class invariant is still respected. In this way rights and obligations
of both client and supplier are clearly delineated, along with their
responsibilities. This idea was first implemented in the Eiffel
language [<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/goals.htm#Meyer92b"><cite>23</cite></a>] under the name <em>Design by Contract</em>, and is now
available with a range of expressive power into several other programming
languages (such as Java) and even in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) with
the Object Constraint Language (OCL) [<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/goals.htm#Warmer98"><cite>32</cite></a>].</p><br />
<br />
<p>Some prototypes in laboratories provide answers to these problems, but
the massive adoption of UML in many industrial domains open new perspectives to
make the underlying ideas evolve, scale up, and hence become
profitable. Unlike its predecessors, (omt, Booch, etc.), that only
proposed a graphical syntax, UML is partially formalized by a meta-model
(expressed itself as a UML model) and contains a very sophisticated constraint
language called OCL (<em>Object Constraint Language</em>), that can be used
indifferently at the model level or at the meta-model level. All this makes it possible to
consider formal manipulations of models that capture many
aspects of software, both from the technical side, (with the four UML main
dimensions : data, functional, dynamic, and deployment) and on the process
side, ranging from the expression of requirements and the analysis to design
(framework models and design patterns) and test implantation. </p><br />

<h4>Mathematical foundations of distributed software</h4>
<p><b>keywords :</b> Labelled Transition Systems, Partial orders.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Labelled transitions systems are the mathematical structure that characterizes
best the foundations of research on software models. This structure was
developed 50 years ago. However, models of real systems can be very large, and
it is not always possible to build the complete model before performing a
formal manipulation. In some cases, it is possible to apply lazy construction
methods (also called on the fly). Concurrency is another fundamental aspect
that must be considered by models. This is the central concept needed for the
analysis of distributed systems.</p><br />
<br />


<h5> Labelled Transition Systems</h5>
<p>A lts is a directed graph which edges are labelled by letters
representing events. A finite state automaton designates a LTS which set of
states and edges is finite. This model is the simplest way known to represent
behaviors of reactive systems. </p><br />
<br />
<p>Transition systems can be obtained from specifications of systems described
with high-level languages such as UML. This is done through a definition of an operational semantics of the
language, which is usually formalized as a set of deduction rules. For simple
languages such as process algebras, this operational semantics can be defined
with a dozen of rules. For a complex language like UML, the definition of rules
can take hundreds of pages. </p><br />
<br />
<p>For performance reasons, the operational semantics rules are never used as
such, and some simplifications such as state encoding help saving some
space. Usually, algorithms inherited from language theory are based on an
explicit construction of a transition system. However, for the class of
problems that are considered within the Triskell project, and exhaustive
representation of the LTS is not always needed, and a lazy construction method
can be used: the only part of the specification needed for the algorithm is
computed. Similarly, some parts of a LTS under construction can be
``forgotten'', hence saving memory. The combination of these strategies allows
the study of real size specifications with reasonable resources.</p><br />
<br />


<h5> Non interleaved models</h5>
<p>One of the main drawbacks of interleaved models is that concurrency is
represented by means of interleavings. Hence, it is sometimes impossible to
differentiate concurrency and branching in a specification. Furthermore,
representing all possible interleavings of some behaviors is not always
necessary to check a given property, and needs a lot of memory space. Partial
order models bring a solution to this problem. They can represent concurrency
in a more intuitive way: two concurrent events are not causally related. </p><br />
<br />
<p>Several partial order models are frequently used: Petri nets, Pom-sets, event
structures, ... It is possible to get back to a transition system
representation of a finite partial order representation by considering marking
graphs for Petri nets,
linearisations of Pom-sets, or configurations of event structures.
Within the project, partial orders are seen as the most natural way for
providing a semantics to scenarios (MSC, UML sequence diagrams,...). </p><br />

<h3>Application domains</h3>


<h4>Software for telecommunication</h4>
<p><b>keywords : </b>
telecommunication, software engineering, test, UML<br />
<br />
The telecommunication world is evolving rapidly. New worldwide
infrastructures connecting multiple components are settling. Mobile
communications is also a growing sector and new services are constantly
developed. </p><br />
<br />
<p>On the software point of view, building a new application from scratch is no
longer possible. There is a real need for flexible solutions allowing to deal at
the same time with a wide range of needs (product lines modeling and
methodologies for managing them), while reducing the time to market (such as
derivation and validation tools). </p><br />
<br />
<p>The Triskell project has gained experience in model engineering, and finds here
a propitious domain. The increasing software complexity and the
reliability and reusability requirements fully justify the methods developed
by our project. The main themes studied are reliable software components
composition, UML-based developments validation, and test generation from
UML models. </p><br />
<br />
<p>The research activity in Triskell focuses at the same time on development
efficiency and reliability. The main applications of this research is clearly
related to the telecommunication domain, and mainly concern reliable
construction of communication software, and object oriented systems testing. <br />
<br />
Reliability is an essential requirement in a context where a huge number of
softwares (and sometimes several versions of the same program) may coexist in a
big telecommunication network. On one hand, software should be able to evolve
very fast, as new features or services are frequently added to existing ones,
but on the other hand, the occurrence of a fault in a system can be
very costly, and time consuming. A lot of attention should then be paid to
interoperability, i.e. the ability for software to work properly with other. We
think that formal methods may help solving this kind of problems.
Note that formal methods should be more and more integrated in an approach
allowing system designer to build software globally, in order to take into
account constraints and objectives coming from user requirements. These
methodologies are in their early years. A good example of such techniques is
the object oriented approach, which is becoming more popular in the
telecommunication world.<br />
<br />
Software testing is another aspect of reliable development. Testing activities
mainly consist in ensuring that a system implementation conforms to its
specifications. Whatever the efforts spent for development, this phase is of
real importance to ensure that a system behaves properly in a complex
environment.<br /></p>
